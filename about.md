My name is Krisna Gupta, but I colloquially known as Imed. I am an economics PhD students at Crawford School of Public Policy, Australian National University (Check out my profile page [here](https://crawford.anu.edu.au/people/phd/krisna-gupta)). My research is about the impact of trade and investment liberalization, in particular to Industries in Indonesia. I hold a master degree in economics from [Universitas Indonesia](http://ppie.feb.ui.ac.id/kurikulum/kurikulum-program-s2-linkage/) and [VU University Amsterdam](https://sbe.vu.nl/en/). it was a joint degree.

Aside from working on my PhD thesis, I am an affiliate at [Center for Indonesia Policy Studies](https://www.cips-indonesia.org/) (CIPS).

My research revolves really around Indonesia. Having a background in planning division in Indonesian Ministry of Industry, I am drawn to policies on trade and industry and how they can help Indonesia grow using manufacturing as its driver. Trade Agreements, Global Value Chain, Non-Tariff Measures and investment policies are among things I read a lot about. I use both structural model such as CGE (mainly GTAP Model) and empirical econometrics, mostly panel data regression and PPLM, a relatively recent method in gravity model. COVID-19 skewed my activity a little bit, that is, I wrote quite a lot on COVID-19 in Indonesia.

I was a bureaucrat at Ministry of Industry in Indonesia, working in planning and evaluation division, before pursuing a master degree. Not too long after I finished my master degree, I switch to academic career path, became a lecturer  (fungsional dosen) at [Politeknik APP Jakarta](https://poltekapp.ac.id/), a diploma school under Ministry of Industry. My plan after finishing my PhD is to go back to Politeknik APP.
