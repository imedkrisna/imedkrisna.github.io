It is assumed that people has zero experience with using any programing language at all. Experience with spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheet is certainly helpful but not needed. This book will not cover a lot of the theoretical part of statistics. Readers are assumed to understand that already. A little bit of intro will be given but that is pretty much it. Readers are expected to understand already the theory behind these techniques, or are expected to learn it from elsewhere. 1.2 About R 1.2.1 What is R 1.2.2 Good reasons to start with R 1.2.2.1 popular 1.2.2.2 easy to learn 1.2.2.3 open source 1.2.3 Computer requirements krisna.gupta@anu.edu.au↩︎ "],

We write R command in this window. 2.2.2 script window Forget what we said about the previous window. This is the most important window in RStudio. We write our sets of command in this window 2.2.3 environment window You can observe your environment here, such as the data and variables / series you created. This window also have other useful tab such as “history” which can show you the history of what happens in your environment, but we will skip them for now. 2.2.4 files window Although we call it ‘files window’, this window consists of 5 tabs. The tab file shows your working directory. When you run a code that generates file such as graphics, it will be stored in this window. Plots tab shows you your latest plot. Packages tab show you all the package that you have. You can also add new package from this tab instead of using the install.packages() command. In this tab, you can also activate package that you have instead of using library() command. “help” tab will show you some information about things that you ask help for when you use ?'command' command. Will show you how it works in a minute. Lastly, “viewer” tab. I actually forgot why it exists so whatever. 2.3 using your console window 2.4 using Rscript 2.5 package 2.6 Update You need to keep your R, RStudio and your installed packages updated as much as you can.

We also covers data types and why it matters. 3.1 Setting your preamble Firstly, it is a good idea to start your script with a clearing environment sets of code. # Close all graphics, clear memory and screen graphics.off(); remove(list=ls());cat(&quot;\\14&quot;); There are three different command in this script. graphics.off() clears out the environment from any graphs from previous R session. the command remove(list=ls()) is used to remove your environment from any data and variables/series that you may have. Lastly, cat(\"\\14\") clears your console window. You need to set your working directory setwd(&#39;your directory&#39;) "],
