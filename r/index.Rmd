# Some Introduction

ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

## About this book

### What is this book and why

### Learning outcome
Information in this book would help you to:

- install and update R and Rstudio with ease
- input, edit, and manage dataset
- visualise dataset as needed
- conducting hypothesis testing
- running a regression
- write a report using the results from above

### Pre-requisite
This book is intended to anyone who are interested in learning statistics using R language. It is assumed that people has zero experience with using any programing language at all. Experience with spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheet is certainly helpful but not needed.

This book will not cover a lot of the theoretical part of statistics. Readers are assumed to understand that already. A little bit of intro will be given but that is pretty much it. Readers are expected to understand already the theory behind these techniques, or are expected to learn it from elsewhere.
