This chapter contains instruction the most basic and useful commands in R. We also covers data types and why it matters.

## Setting your preamble

Firstly, it is a good idea to start your script with a clearing environment sets of code.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Close all graphics, clear memory and screen
graphics.off(); remove(list=ls());cat("\14");
```
There are three different command in this script. `graphics.off()` clears out the environment from any graphs from previous R session. the command `remove(list=ls())` is used to remove your environment from any data and variables/series that you may have. Lastly, `cat("\14")` clears your console window.

You need to set your working directory
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
setwd('your directory')
```
