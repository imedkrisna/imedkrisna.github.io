Dikutip dari [Julia Suryakusuma (2014) di The Jakarta Post](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/09/03/depok-potholes-and-a-new-breed-leaders.html):
> "Whether it's urban planning, infrastructure building, transportation, balancing the interests of the public with those of big businesses, keeping the culture and history of Depok alive, achieving a clean government as well as a clean city, Nur Mahmudi's administration has failed miserably. Instead of turning Depok into a green belt of parks and trees, and a blue belt of ponds and water catchments, (JJ) Rizal says the colors of Depok, are now fifty shades of gray."
